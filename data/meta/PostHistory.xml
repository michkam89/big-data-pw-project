This of course applies to [Super User](http://superuser.com/) as well. And Stack Overflow itself continuously evolves! Hence a never-ending stream of questions at [Meta](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/). Office culture—no, more broadly, _working_ culture evolves, from 9-5ers to freelancers, from startups to corporations, giving [Workplace](http://workplace.stackexchange.com/) its lifeblood, and laws too—changing laws are also a big component to the evolution which supports [Personal Finance and Money](http://money.stackexchange.com/). One last interesting example is [English Language &amp;amp; Usage](http://english.stackexchange.com/), where both language and its more rapidly changing context give rise to new questions like [&quot;Is there a non-sexual phrase for sleeping with someone?&quot;](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/148323/is-there-a-non-sexual-phrase-for-sleeping-with-someone).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, there are sites whose underlying subjects _don't_ necessarily evolve (or evolve very fast), _e.g._ [History](http://history.stackexchange.com/). But the sheer size and/or intricacy of the subject lends it sustained opportunities for exploration—delving in to find genuinely new and interesting questions. Though sites like [Mathematica](http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/) are bound to a (mostly) set language, from the (at least, seemingly) unlimited power of the language arises a huge domain of applications that users are continuously exploring, _still_ surprised by the discovery of new challenges, new workarounds, and new techniques.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I ask,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### What kind of questions will keep Beer.SE alive?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;with a preliminary opninion in mind, but one I don't feel qualified to develop into an answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It doesn't feel to me that Beer has as rich a history as, well, History itself, nor does it appear to lend itself to &quot;new applications&quot; and &quot;ways&quot;. Once we exhaust [general questions](http://meta.beer.stackexchange.com/questions/8/should-general-questions-about-beer-be-made-more-specific) about classifications of beer, serving temperatures, skunking, and such, it even seems fathomable that we might get through the large of histories of kinds of beers, as well as techniques for tasting and pairing beers, and then what? What part of Beer keeps evolving that will generate new questions?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To me (and [others too, maybe](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/13493397#13493397)), it seems one of the only evolving aspects of beer we _can_ latch onto, is specific beers and breweries; and putting such in the context of regions, too, would greatly expand what can be asked, and the specificity (and usefulness) of answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The culture against brands is understandable in, say, technology, where products and websites are often ephemeral, and more general answers would help direct future visitors toward the specific answers they need; and the culture against regional questions is understandable too, in that most communities don't want to end up with a hundred questions about the same thing, only differing in a seemingly arbitrary detail (location).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But I don't know if those cultures apply to Beer.SE. **Our very subject is embedded in products,** whereas for technology the subject is an abstraction away from products. And, **our &quot;problems&quot; regarding beer are sometimes _going_ to be regional**—finding beers to taste and exploring breweries seem like important activities for beer enthusiasts, activities necessarily tied to location.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What are your thoughts?"

As noted, cider is closer to wine in production. As such, the questions and discussions of brewing techniques/technology will be less relevant to the those looking for cider information. There could also be less chance that people could usefully contributed to beer discussions if they are primarily interested in cider. It seems like cider would be too off-topic in this case since the motivation is the underlying production. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Consider the user base. Cider and beer are, right or wrong, frequently grouped together for sales, at parties, at bars, etc. One reason for this might be the placement of cider on taps. The real issue, however, is that since these two products are seen as very similar by consumers, this site could include cider as on-topic, drawing a greater audience, even if some of the discussion would be technically different from the beer discussions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not sure I've got a great argument for one against the other.

These can include making a honey-wine or even distilled into a liquor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I think it would be on a case by case basis that you would determine if this was off topic or not.

Especially because I'm _not_ an expert in beer (a title more befitting the other mods), I'm surprised by how frequently my friends and colleagues, at bars, breweries, and restaurants, wonder and ask questions about beer that I happen to be able to discuss or answer, solely from reading a new topic on here every few days. (Most of my friends and colleagues don't know I moderate a site about beer.) Again, I'm not saying this is a good reason to keep a beta open. Besides, I'm in a unique position, granted a responsibility that motivates me to review all the questions—a motivation others must find in pure interest (and perhaps reputation).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Does the site still have potential?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I really want to know, if it were up to me to decide the fate of this site, is whether it still has the _potential_ to become _the place to go_ when someone has a question about beer. As I've argued [before](http://meta.beer.stackexchange.com/questions/55/what-kinds-of-questions-will-keep-beer-se-active-relax-the-culture-against-bra), I think the _real_ problem is that there are only so many _general_ questions one can ask about beer. When a question does arise however, where do people go to find out or ask? The goal is to make that place, **here**. The feeling of _knowing exactly where to ask_ is the joy I've found in Stack Exchange. Can we make this, _that place_?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Googling [beer questions](https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+questions), I see that not a single link in the first 100 results offers a place to ask a community of users about beer, except for one: us, on page 5. Next I search [beer question answer](https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+question+answer), and again find nothing in the first 100 results, except for two: [homebrew.se](http://homebrew.stackexchange.com) and us, side by side on page 2.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But okay, you've got me: actually my Google-fu is to blame. Search [beer discussion](https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+discussion) and there are a plethora of active communities discussing beer—BeerAdvocate, Realbeer.com, Home Brew Talk, etc.—and it's _us_ who can't be found in the first 100 results. Same goes for searching [beer community](https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+community) and [beer forum](https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+forum) (not that we are a forum—but it's what people would search).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the thing is, _all_ of these other communities, being _discussion forums_, lack the unique model of Stack Exchange that promotes the best answers to the top and employs the community to organize knowledge in an accessible and duplicate-free way. We're far behind in terms of exposure, but we've still got _something_ no one else seems to have. The question is—Does that _something_ justify the existence of this site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Is there more we can do to meet our potential?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think so, and I feel guilty that I haven't taken the initiative to write this earlier, so thank you @dwjohnston for asking the question that needed to be asked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, we might petition the Stack Exchange team to help us improve our SEO, for example by making sure that words like _discussion_, _community_, and _forum_ get picked up by crawlers. (No, I have no understanding of SEO; so please do enlighten me where I'm being naive.) Not all SE sites might like such exposure, since the SE platform isn't intended to be anything like a discussion forum especially. But, I think Beer.SE is a case where I think it would strengthen us to draw in those searching for &quot;forums&quot; to ask their questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second, we might coordinate efforts to gain exposure in existing communities like BeerAdvocate, Realbeer.com, and Home Brew Talk.

My experience with SE sites is that if you build them, people come. Ask, answer and watch the visits flow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what does that leave us to do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Ask good questions. A lot of the questions here are kind of mediocre, let's see if we can get some really good focused narrow questions&#xD;&#xA; - Focus on asking about *specific* beer styles and brands instead of general &quot;beer&quot; questions. &#xD;&#xA; - As local questions. Promote at local pubs/breweries. Get local answers (A huge part of modern beer is local breweries, we can be an awesome resource for those).&#xD;&#xA; - Promote this site to your friends. This is the way to get experts and enthusiasts to show up. If you're hanging at the pub and someone has a question about a beer, have them ask it here!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So overall, while the numbers are kinda of lousy, SE hasn't said &quot;hey, you're in danger of closing up shop&quot; yet so there's still plenty of time to make this site a cool place.

Thanks for participating in the meta as well as the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As discussed elsewhere in the meta, the consensus at Beer.SE is, unlike other stack exchanges, to allow regional questions _as long as they are sufficiently constrained_. There are hundreds of countries that produce beer, and therefore, although I think it's indeed a useful question, I agreed (with whoever cast the first close vote) that the question was [too broad].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Take a look at this question: [What does AngularJS do better than jQuery? [closed]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18414012/what-does-angularjs-do-better-than-jquery).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Try to remember that questions aren't closed because they're not useful, but rather because they don't fit certain site guidelines. Even if I don't personally agree with site guidelines (I'm actually closer to your side than you might think), as a moderator I am somewhat obligated to enforce the guidelines as set by the community. You'll still get reputation for upvotes of course—you just won't be seeing any new answers, since, it's been decreed the question covers too much ground and lacks specificity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, you've reminded me of this question of mine: http://beer.stackexchange.com/questions/580/local-beers-to-try-at-airports-major-airports-only. To give you some context, at the time, the site was very young and I was trying to increase community participation by asking a &quot;fun&quot; question—a question any of us might remember the next time we're at a brewery in an airport. Some users commented immediately that the question wasn't well-suited for an SE site; I shared their sentiments and agreed to a motion to close. However, one might argue users aren't willing to act &quot;against&quot; a moderator. (Though, personally, I don't see close votes as antagonistic, at all. Also, I try to respect users by believing in their willingness to express honest thoughts; similarly I hope I have users' respect in trusting me to be able to handle said thoughts.) Now, the above question, I attempted to &quot;constrain&quot; by defining a &quot;minimum enplanements&quot; threshold. However, since I'm also allowing 1 airport per country _regardless_ off that criterion, clearly my question is even less constrained than yours! And especially since the site has grown and there's less of a need for the original purpose I sought to fulfill (fun, immediate participation), I will be consistent in my judgments and close my own question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please don't hesitate to speak up about things like this in the future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you still disagree with my judgment, that's okay! If you believe your question would be valid as a community wiki, then please find a meta.stackexchange.com post that helps substantiate your reasoning. (I'm placing the burden of proof on you, since the community has already voted according to its established system.)" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The moderator @badp replied:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The kind of question seeding we frown upon the hardest is the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; systematic one, as in a bunch of largely identical questions that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; differ slightly (e.g. asking &quot;how can I obtain an X&quot; for every item in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; an RPG). Either phrase the question more generally, or only ask for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; values of X that you actually are struggling/have struggled with.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I side with this advice myself. For example, asking the BTU range for an IPA, then for a double IPA, then for a Pale Ale, and so on in separate questions, would be suspect. Instead, I'd encourage either (1) asking generally in a manner that seeks to answers some central curiosity of all these questions, or (2) asking about one or two kinds of beer due to genuine interest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An even better example is when we discussed [brand- or region-specific questions on this site](http://meta.beer.stackexchange.com/a/86/73). Questions like &quot;Where can I find _&amp;lt;beer&amp;gt;_ in _&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;_?&quot; aren't great questions to spawn for the sake of increasing questions—they're often too specialized to help any future visitor. But when someone asks because they're genuinely having trouble finding a beer (and we seem to get this often from people who go abroad and can't get their hands on a beer they used to get at home), then we welcome the question. @MonicaCellio pretty much sums it up:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Limiting it to questions people actually care about should mitigate the fear of flooding the site with trivial questions. On the other hand, barring all of them just because some could be abusive, with our current question rate, seems unwise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All this may very well be obvious to you, so maybe I haven't provided much of an answer. So to answer in another way, I'd say this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;b&gt;Go for it.&lt;/b&gt; Just use some discretion and common sense as you go along. If you're unsure about a post, then bump it to the bottom of your list and come back to it. If you're still unsure, try asking just the question and letting someone else respond, at least for 24 or 48 hours, before you self-answer. If your posts start looking a little spammy or gratuitous, @Xander and I will keep this conscientious meta post in mind, and let you know in a comment. If you get downvoted by others, you have this meta post to reference in defense (but perhaps the downvotes are also an objective indicator of how your questions sound to the community). In any case, the worst that can happen is you delete a few questions.

I doubt that expanding the scope of this _particular_ site to other alcohols or alcohol in general is the right path, though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my experience, there's little correlation between knowledge about beer and knowledge about wines, spirits or other alcoholic drinks. And often, people who are really into beer may know nothing at all about, say, wine or vodka. Serious interest in beer _does_ seem to lead to dabbling in homebrewing, though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, granted, my experience may not be representative of the world at large, and I'm willing to be convinced otherwise, but I haven't seen much evidence yet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The point of all this is that expanding into new territory doesn't really help overall site health if the site's existing users wouldn't participate in there and any new users wouldn't contribute to the &quot;old territory.&quot; It'd basically be like operating two small, independent sites that just happen to share a URL for some reason that nobody understands.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I suppose you could take everything I've said so far as a very long concurrence/upvote for bluefeet's answer.

Text="When it comes to Beer SE to merge with other alcohol sites, it seems to me that we should be more willing to broaden our horizon, than simply just merging with Homebrewing SE. It would seem the natural step to include the Wine Proposal into this equation since wine homebrewing is already on-topic ot Homebrewing SE. The way I feel is that we should include all aspects of alcohol related topics into any expansion if we were to consider doing  so. Not only should we consider merging with Homebrewing SE and the new Wine Proposal, but we could also include distilled products such as liquors and liqueurs, as well the subject of distillation in any future ideas we need to bring to the table if in fact we truly want to expand our horizons here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This how I see things now and cannot speak for others.

But even if it can be created, a tag that general is probably not that useful.  Beer questions that are about a particular type of beer (stouts, IPAs, etc) are tagged by style now, and we should keep doing that.  I'm having trouble seeing the utility of *also* tagging them &quot;beer&quot;, especially since we want this site to grow.  That'd be a huge number of questions, right?  How would you use that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, you might ask, what about [tag:wine]?  Yes, you're right -- that's going to cause the same problem later.  (I hope you don't mind my putting words in your mouth like this. :-) )  Wine is newly in scope and there aren't a lot of questions yet, but in time I expect we'll see subdivisions there.  Perhaps we should go ahead and start with [tag:red-wines] and [tag:white-wines] right off the bat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now some questions really *don't* care about the type of beer or wine; they're questions about storage or production or something else.  In those cases we have other tags already.  So there *might* be utility for tags like &quot;beer, any type&quot;, but we should study our existing questions before deciding (and naming) such a tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tag ontologies are hard, and on most sites I participate on, the tag set evolves, inconsistently, over time.  Trying to organize all the things systematically is probably just going to cause you to pull your hair out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, when doing large-scale retaggings, please try to not break the front page too badly.

While production questions are in-scope too, first and foremost this site is for *consumers* of alcoholic beverages.  The verb does a better job of conveying that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Drink*s* would create more ambiguity; we'd get some questions about non-alcoholic drinks and, in particular, would need to redirect some questions to Coffee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stack Exchange has historically been a little inconsistent about verbs versus nouns -- Writers but Worldbuilding, Astronomy but Community Building, Ask Ubuntu but Academia, Programmers but Programming Puzzles.  So I think we're free to go either way here, especially in a subdomain (I'm not talking about the site name here).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The subdomain is memorable and easily typed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the downside, I wonder if drinking carries a connotation of &quot;to excess&quot;; do people hear &quot;drinking&quot; and think of frat parties?  Anybody who stops to think about it would likely conclude no, because a whole Q&amp;A site about that kind of drinking doesn't make sense, but first impressions matter.

Beer questions that are about a particular type of beer (stouts, IPAs, etc) are tagged by style now, and we should keep doing that.  I'm having trouble seeing the utility of *also* tagging them &quot;beer&quot;, especially since we want this site to grow.  That'd be a huge number of questions, right?  How would you use that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, you might ask, what about [tag:wine]?  Yes, you're right -- that's going to cause the same problem later.  (I hope you don't mind my putting words in your mouth like this. :-) )  Wine is newly in scope and there aren't a lot of questions yet, but in time I expect we'll see subdivisions there.  Perhaps we should go ahead and start with [tag:red-wines] and [tag:white-wines] right off the bat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now some questions really *don't* care about the type of beer or wine; they're questions about storage or production or something else.  In those cases we have other tags already.  So there *might* be utility for tags like &quot;beer, any type&quot;, but we should study our existing questions before deciding (and naming) such a tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tag ontologies are hard, and on most sites I participate on, the tag set evolves, inconsistently, over time.  Trying to organize all the things systematically is probably just going to cause you to pull your hair out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, when doing large-scale retaggings, please try to not break the front page too badly.

The moderator @badp replied:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The kind of question seeding we frown upon the hardest is the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; systematic one, as in a bunch of largely identical questions that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; differ slightly (e.g. asking &quot;how can I obtain an X&quot; for every item in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; an RPG). Either phrase the question more generally, or only ask for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; values of X that you actually are struggling/have struggled with.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I side with this advice myself. For example, asking the BTU range for an IPA, then for a double IPA, then for a Pale Ale, and so on in separate questions, would be suspect. Instead, I'd encourage either (1) asking generally in a manner that seeks to answers some central curiosity of all these questions, or (2) asking about one or two kinds of beer due to genuine interest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An even better example is when we discussed [brand- or region-specific questions on this site](http://meta.beer.stackexchange.com/a/86/73). Questions like &quot;Where can I find _&amp;lt;beer&amp;gt;_ in _&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;_?&quot; aren't great questions to spawn for the sake of increasing questions—they're often too specialized to help any future visitor. But when someone asks because they're genuinely having trouble finding a beer (and we seem to get this often from people who go abroad and can't get their hands on a beer they used to get at home), then we welcome the question. @MonicaCellio pretty much sums it up:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Limiting it to questions people actually care about should mitigate the fear of flooding the site with trivial questions. On the other hand, barring all of them just because some could be abusive, with our current question rate, seems unwise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All this may very well be obvious to you, so maybe I haven't provided much of an answer. So to answer in another way, I'd say this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;b&gt;Go for it.&lt;/b&gt; Just use some discretion and common sense as you go along. If you're unsure about a post, then bump it to the bottom of your list and come back to it. If you're still unsure, try asking just the question and letting someone else respond, at least for 24 or 48 hours, before you self-answer. If your posts start looking a little spammy or gratuitous, @Xander and I will keep this conscientious meta post in mind, and let you know in a comment. If you get downvoted by others, you have this meta post to reference in defense (but perhaps the downvotes are also an objective indicator of how your questions sound to the community). In any case, the worst that can happen is you delete a few questions.

This of course applies to [Super User](http://superuser.com/) as well. And Stack Overflow itself continuously evolves! Hence a never-ending stream of questions at [Meta](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/). Office culture—no, more broadly, _working_ culture evolves, from 9-5ers to freelancers, from startups to corporations, giving [Workplace](http://workplace.stackexchange.com/) its lifeblood, and laws too—changing laws are also a big component to the evolution which supports [Personal Finance and Money](http://money.stackexchange.com/). One last interesting example is [English Language &amp;amp; Usage](http://english.stackexchange.com/), where both language and its more rapidly changing context give rise to new questions like [&quot;Is there a non-sexual phrase for sleeping with someone?&quot;](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/148323/is-there-a-non-sexual-phrase-for-sleeping-with-someone).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**...or the subject is huge (whether in breadth or depth)**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, there are sites whose underlying subjects _don't_ necessarily evolve (or at least not very fast), _e.g._ [History](http://history.stackexchange.com/). But the sheer size and/or intricacy of the subject lends it sustained opportunities for exploration—delving in to find genuinely new and interesting questions. Though sites like [Mathematica](http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/) are bound to a (mostly) set language, from the (at least, seemingly) unlimited power of the language arises a huge domain of applications that users are continuously exploring, _still_ surprised by the discovery of new challenges, new workarounds, and new techniques.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I ask,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## What kinds of questions will keep Beer.SE alive?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have a preliminary opinion in mind, but one I don't feel qualified to develop into a full-fledged answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It just doesn't feel to me that Beer has as rich a history as, well, History itself, nor does it appear to lend itself to &quot;new applications&quot; and &quot;ways.&quot; Once we exhaust [general questions](https://alcohol.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8/should-general-questions-about-beer-be-made-more-specific) about classifications of beer, bottling and distribution, temperature and skunking, and such, it seems fathomable we might even get through the histories of most classes of beers, techniques for tasting and pairing beers... and then what? **All these subjects are ones which neither evolve nor introduce any great breadth or depth to be explored.** So what part of Beer _does_ have these qualities, for generating new questions?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To me (and [others too, maybe](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/13493397#13493397)), it seems one of the only evolving aspects of beer we _can_ latch onto, is specific beers and breweries. And putting such in the context of regions, too, would greatly expand what can be asked, and the specificity (and usefulness) of answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the usual culture against brand-specific questions and answers on SE, is understandable regarding, say, technology, where products and websites are often ephemeral, and more general answers would help direct future visitors toward the specific answers they need. And I think the usual culture against regional questions is understandable too, in that most communities don't want to end up with a hundred questions about the same thing, only differing in a seemingly arbitrary detail (location).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, I don't know if those cultures have to carry over to Beer.SE for Beer.SE to be an equally interesting and useful community. **Our very subject is _embedded_ in its products,** whereas for technology, the subject is often an abstraction away from the products. And, **our &quot;problems&quot; regarding beer are sometimes _going_ to be regional**—finding beers to taste and exploring breweries seem like important activities for beer enthusiasts—activities necessarily tied to location.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What are your thoughts?"

I felt that such questions, asked with no &quot;skin in the game,&quot; would necessarily be of low(er) quality, because we don't tend to think things through as much when we're not _personally_ involved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, I'm currently in San Diego but originally from New York City and visit family and friends there often, so when asking about NYC, I have some vested interest in getting _useful_ answers, and care more about specificity, _e.g._ I don't necessarily want to know about breweries inaccessible by NYC's public transportation system, since I almost never have a car while there. Such considerations would not enter my mind were I asking about, for example, Austin, TX, a place I've never been and don't have any current plans to visit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, I propose that, **while we _should_ feel comfortable asking questions about brands and regions, we should ask &quot;responsibly,&quot; _i.e._ ask questions we earnestly imagine ourselves _making use of_ in an upcoming trip or encounter—questions that benefit us _personally_.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Feel free to link this meta post when asking regional questions, as a &quot;disclaimer.&quot; That's why I'm writing it."

One question was potentially relevant: [How to know which SE sites are going to be closed?](http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/questions/6118/how-to-know-which-se-sites-are-going-to-be-closed) So, I don't know how SE does things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Not at all a good reason to keep a beta open, but hey, I make use of my 0.4 a day :-)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, and of course I'm biased, I enjoy reading a new question every 2-3 days, even if that's all there is. Especially because I'm _not_ an expert in beer (a title more befitting the other mods), I'm surprised by how frequently my friends and colleagues, at bars, breweries, and restaurants, wonder and ask questions about beer that I happen to be able to discuss or answer, solely from reading a new topic on here every few days. (Most of my friends and colleagues don't know I moderate a site about beer.) Again, I'm not saying this is a good reason to keep a beta open. Besides, I'm in a unique position, granted a responsibility that motivates me to review all the questions—a motivation others must find in pure interest (and perhaps reputation).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Does the site still have potential?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I really want to know, if it were up to me to decide the fate of this site, is whether it still has the _potential_ to become _the place to go_ when someone has a question about beer. As I've argued [before](https://alcohol.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/55/what-kinds-of-questions-will-keep-beer-se-active-relax-the-culture-against-bra), I think the _real_ problem is that there are only so many _general_ questions one can ask about beer. When a question does arise however, where do people go to find out or ask? The goal is to make that place, **here**. The feeling of _knowing exactly where to ask_ is the joy I've found in Stack Exchange. Can we make this, _that place_?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Googling [beer questions](https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+questions), I see that not a single link in the first 100 results offers a place to ask a community of users about beer, except for one: us, on page 5. Next I search [beer question answer](https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+question+answer), and again find nothing in the first 100 results, except for two: [homebrew.se](http://homebrew.stackexchange.com) and us, side by side on page 2.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But okay, you've got me: actually my Google-fu is to blame. Search [beer discussion](https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+discussion) and there are a plethora of active communities discussing beer—BeerAdvocate, Realbeer.com, Home Brew Talk, etc.—and it's _us_ who can't be found in the first 100 results. Same goes for searching [beer community](https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+community) and [beer forum](https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+forum) (not that we are a forum—but it's what people would search).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the thing is, _all_ of these other communities, being _discussion forums_, lack the unique model of Stack Exchange that promotes the best answers to the top and employs the community to organize knowledge in an accessible and duplicate-free way. We're far behind in terms of exposure, but we've still got _something_ no one else seems to have. The question is—Does that _something_ justify the existence of this site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Is there more we can do to meet our potential?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think so, and I feel guilty that I haven't taken the initiative to write this earlier, so thank you @dwjohnston for asking the question that needed to be asked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, we might petition the Stack Exchange team to help us improve our SEO, for example by making sure that words like _discussion_, _community_, and _forum_ get picked up by crawlers. (No, I have no understanding of SEO; so please do enlighten me where I'm being naive.) Not all SE sites might like such exposure, since the SE platform isn't intended to be anything like a discussion forum especially. But, I think Beer.SE is a case where I think it would strengthen us to draw in those searching for &quot;forums&quot; to ask their questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second, we might coordinate efforts to gain exposure in existing communities like BeerAdvocate, Realbeer.com, and Home Brew Talk. We'd want to do this _ethically_—spamming forums with links to our site would only gain us a bad reputation. Exactly how to achieve this, I'm not sure, but perhaps this should be made a separate question for discussion." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The moderator @badp replied:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The kind of question seeding we frown upon the hardest is the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; systematic one, as in a bunch of largely identical questions that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; differ slightly (e.g. asking &quot;how can I obtain an X&quot; for every item in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; an RPG). Either phrase the question more generally, or only ask for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; values of X that you actually are struggling/have struggled with.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I side with this advice myself. For example, asking the BTU range for an IPA, then for a double IPA, then for a Pale Ale, and so on in separate questions, would be suspect. Instead, I'd encourage either (1) asking generally in a manner that seeks to answers some central curiosity of all these questions, or (2) asking about one or two kinds of beer due to genuine interest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An even better example is when we discussed [brand- or region-specific questions on this site](https://alcohol.meta.stackexchange.com/a/86/73). Questions like &quot;Where can I find _&amp;lt;beer&amp;gt;_ in _&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;_?&quot; aren't great questions to spawn for the sake of increasing questions—they're often too specialized to help any future visitor. But when someone asks because they're genuinely having trouble finding a beer (and we seem to get this often from people who go abroad and can't get their hands on a beer they used to get at home), then we welcome the question. @MonicaCellio pretty much sums it up:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Limiting it to questions people actually care about should mitigate the fear of flooding the site with trivial questions. On the other hand, barring all of them just because some could be abusive, with our current question rate, seems unwise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All this may very well be obvious to you, so maybe I haven't provided much of an answer. So to answer in another way, I'd say this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;b&gt;Go for it.&lt;/b&gt; Just use some discretion and common sense as you go along. If you're unsure about a post, then bump it to the bottom of your list and come back to it. If you're still unsure, try asking just the question and letting someone else respond, at least for 24 or 48 hours, before you self-answer. If your posts start looking a little spammy or gratuitous, @Xander and I will keep this conscientious meta post in mind, and let you know in a comment. If you get downvoted by others, you have this meta post to reference in defense (but perhaps the downvotes are also an objective indicator of how your questions sound to the community).

Thanks for participating in the meta as well as the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As discussed elsewhere in the meta, the consensus at Beer.SE is, unlike other stack exchanges, to allow regional questions _as long as they are sufficiently constrained_. There are hundreds of countries that produce beer, and therefore, although I think it's indeed a useful question, I agreed (with whoever cast the first close vote) that the question was [too broad].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Take a look at this question: [What does AngularJS do better than jQuery? [closed]](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18414012/what-does-angularjs-do-better-than-jquery).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Try to remember that questions aren't closed because they're not useful, but rather because they don't fit certain site guidelines. Even if I don't personally agree with site guidelines (I'm actually closer to your side than you might think), as a moderator I am somewhat obligated to enforce the guidelines as set by the community. You'll still get reputation for upvotes of course—you just won't be seeing any new answers, since, it's been decreed the question covers too much ground and lacks specificity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, you've reminded me of this question of mine: https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/580/local-beers-to-try-at-airports-major-airports-only. To give you some context, at the time, the site was very young and I was trying to increase community participation by asking a &quot;fun&quot; question—a question any of us might remember the next time we're at a brewery in an airport. Some users commented immediately that the question wasn't well-suited for an SE site; I shared their sentiments and agreed to a motion to close. However, one might argue users aren't willing to act &quot;against&quot; a moderator. (Though, personally, I don't see close votes as antagonistic, at all. Also, I try to respect users by believing in their willingness to express honest thoughts; similarly I hope I have users' respect in trusting me to be able to handle said thoughts.) Now, the above question, I attempted to &quot;constrain&quot; by defining a &quot;minimum enplanements&quot; threshold. However, since I'm also allowing 1 airport per country _regardless_ off that criterion, clearly my question is even less constrained than yours! And especially since the site has grown and there's less of a need for the original purpose I sought to fulfill (fun, immediate participation), I will be consistent in my judgments and close my own question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please don't hesitate to speak up about things like this in the future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you still disagree with my judgment, that's okay! If you believe your question would be valid as a community wiki, then please find a meta.stackexchange.com post that helps substantiate your reasoning. (I'm placing the burden of proof on you, since the community has already voted according to its established system.)" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This of course applies to [Super User](https://superuser.com/) as well. And Stack Overflow itself continuously evolves! Hence a never-ending stream of questions at [Meta](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/). Office culture—no, more broadly, _working_ culture evolves, from 9-5ers to freelancers, from startups to corporations, giving [Workplace](http://workplace.stackexchange.com/) its lifeblood, and laws too—changing laws are also a big component to the evolution which supports [Personal Finance and Money](https://money.stackexchange.com/). One last interesting example is [English Language &amp;amp; Usage](http://english.stackexchange.com/), where both language and its more rapidly changing context give rise to new questions like [&quot;Is there a non-sexual phrase for sleeping with someone?&quot;](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/148323/is-there-a-non-sexual-phrase-for-sleeping-with-someone).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**...or the subject is huge (whether in breadth or depth)**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, there are sites whose underlying subjects _don't_ necessarily evolve (or at least not very fast), _e.g._ [History](http://history.stackexchange.com/). But the sheer size and/or intricacy of the subject lends it sustained opportunities for exploration—delving in to find genuinely new and interesting questions. Though sites like [Mathematica](http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/) are bound to a (mostly) set language, from the (at least, seemingly) unlimited power of the language arises a huge domain of applications that users are continuously exploring, _still_ surprised by the discovery of new challenges, new workarounds, and new techniques.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I ask,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## What kinds of questions will keep Beer.SE alive?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have a preliminary opinion in mind, but one I don't feel qualified to develop into a full-fledged answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It just doesn't feel to me that Beer has as rich a history as, well, History itself, nor does it appear to lend itself to &quot;new applications&quot; and &quot;ways.&quot; Once we exhaust [general questions](https://alcohol.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8/should-general-questions-about-beer-be-made-more-specific) about classifications of beer, bottling and distribution, temperature and skunking, and such, it seems fathomable we might even get through the histories of most classes of beers, techniques for tasting and pairing beers... and then what? **All these subjects are ones which neither evolve nor introduce any great breadth or depth to be explored.** So what part of Beer _does_ have these qualities, for generating new questions?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To me (and [others too, maybe](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/13493397#13493397)), it seems one of the only evolving aspects of beer we _can_ latch onto, is specific beers and breweries. And putting such in the context of regions, too, would greatly expand what can be asked, and the specificity (and usefulness) of answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the usual culture against brand-specific questions and answers on SE, is understandable regarding, say, technology, where products and websites are often ephemeral, and more general answers would help direct future visitors toward the specific answers they need. And I think the usual culture against regional questions is understandable too, in that most communities don't want to end up with a hundred questions about the same thing, only differing in a seemingly arbitrary detail (location).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, I don't know if those cultures have to carry over to Beer.SE for Beer.SE to be an equally interesting and useful community. **Our very subject is _embedded_ in its products,** whereas for technology, the subject is often an abstraction away from the products.

Especially because I'm _not_ an expert in beer (a title more befitting the other mods), I'm surprised by how frequently my friends and colleagues, at bars, breweries, and restaurants, wonder and ask questions about beer that I happen to be able to discuss or answer, solely from reading a new topic on here every few days. (Most of my friends and colleagues don't know I moderate a site about beer.) Again, I'm not saying this is a good reason to keep a beta open. Besides, I'm in a unique position, granted a responsibility that motivates me to review all the questions—a motivation others must find in pure interest (and perhaps reputation).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Does the site still have potential?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I really want to know, if it were up to me to decide the fate of this site, is whether it still has the _potential_ to become _the place to go_ when someone has a question about beer. As I've argued [before](https://alcohol.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/55/what-kinds-of-questions-will-keep-beer-se-active-relax-the-culture-against-bra), I think the _real_ problem is that there are only so many _general_ questions one can ask about beer. When a question does arise however, where do people go to find out or ask? The goal is to make that place, **here**. The feeling of _knowing exactly where to ask_ is the joy I've found in Stack Exchange. Can we make this, _that place_?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Googling [beer questions](https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+questions), I see that not a single link in the first 100 results offers a place to ask a community of users about beer, except for one: us, on page 5. Next I search [beer question answer](https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+question+answer), and again find nothing in the first 100 results, except for two: [homebrew.se](http://homebrew.stackexchange.com) and us, side by side on page 2.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But okay, you've got me: actually my Google-fu is to blame. Search [beer discussion](https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+discussion) and there are a plethora of active communities discussing beer—BeerAdvocate, Realbeer.com, Home Brew Talk, etc.—and it's _us_ who can't be found in the first 100 results. Same goes for searching [beer community](https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+community) and [beer forum](https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+forum) (not that we are a forum—but it's what people would search).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the thing is, _all_ of these other communities, being _discussion forums_, lack the unique model of Stack Exchange that promotes the best answers to the top and employs the community to organize knowledge in an accessible and duplicate-free way. We're far behind in terms of exposure, but we've still got _something_ no one else seems to have. The question is—Does that _something_ justify the existence of this site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Is there more we can do to meet our potential?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think so, and I feel guilty that I haven't taken the initiative to write this earlier, so thank you @dwjohnston for asking the question that needed to be asked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, we might petition the Stack Exchange team to help us improve our SEO, for example by making sure that words like _discussion_, _community_, and _forum_ get picked up by crawlers. (No, I have no understanding of SEO; so please do enlighten me where I'm being naive.) Not all SE sites might like such exposure, since the SE platform isn't intended to be anything like a discussion forum especially. But, I think Beer.SE is a case where I think it would strengthen us to draw in those searching for &quot;forums&quot; to ask their questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Second, we might coordinate efforts to gain exposure in existing communities like BeerAdvocate, Realbeer.com, and Home Brew Talk. We'd want to do this _ethically_—spamming forums with links to our site would only gain us a bad reputation. Exactly how to achieve this, I'm not sure, but perhaps this should be made a separate question for discussion." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

This of course applies to [Super User](https://superuser.com/) as well. And Stack Overflow itself continuously evolves! Hence a never-ending stream of questions at [Meta](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/). Office culture—no, more broadly, _working_ culture evolves, from 9-5ers to freelancers, from startups to corporations, giving [Workplace](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/) its lifeblood, and laws too—changing laws are also a big component to the evolution which supports [Personal Finance and Money](https://money.stackexchange.com/). One last interesting example is [English Language &amp;amp; Usage](https://english.stackexchange.com/), where both language and its more rapidly changing context give rise to new questions like [&quot;Is there a non-sexual phrase for sleeping with someone?&quot;](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/148323/is-there-a-non-sexual-phrase-for-sleeping-with-someone).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**...or the subject is huge (whether in breadth or depth)**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, there are sites whose underlying subjects _don't_ necessarily evolve (or at least not very fast), _e.g._ [History](https://history.stackexchange.com/). But the sheer size and/or intricacy of the subject lends it sustained opportunities for exploration—delving in to find genuinely new and interesting questions. Though sites like [Mathematica](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/) are bound to a (mostly) set language, from the (at least, seemingly) unlimited power of the language arises a huge domain of applications that users are continuously exploring, _still_ surprised by the discovery of new challenges, new workarounds, and new techniques.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I ask,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## What kinds of questions will keep Beer.SE alive?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have a preliminary opinion in mind, but one I don't feel qualified to develop into a full-fledged answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It just doesn't feel to me that Beer has as rich a history as, well, History itself, nor does it appear to lend itself to &quot;new applications&quot; and &quot;ways.&quot; Once we exhaust [general questions](https://alcohol.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8/should-general-questions-about-beer-be-made-more-specific) about classifications of beer, bottling and distribution, temperature and skunking, and such, it seems fathomable we might even get through the histories of most classes of beers, techniques for tasting and pairing beers... and then what? **All these subjects are ones which neither evolve nor introduce any great breadth or depth to be explored.** So what part of Beer _does_ have these qualities, for generating new questions?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To me (and [others too, maybe](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/13493397#13493397)), it seems one of the only evolving aspects of beer we _can_ latch onto, is specific beers and breweries. And putting such in the context of regions, too, would greatly expand what can be asked, and the specificity (and usefulness) of answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the usual culture against brand-specific questions and answers on SE, is understandable regarding, say, technology, where products and websites are often ephemeral, and more general answers would help direct future visitors toward the specific answers they need. And I think the usual culture against regional questions is understandable too, in that most communities don't want to end up with a hundred questions about the same thing, only differing in a seemingly arbitrary detail (location).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, I don't know if those cultures have to carry over to Beer.SE for Beer.SE to be an equally interesting and useful community. **Our very subject is _embedded_ in its products,** whereas for technology, the subject is often an abstraction away from the products. And, **our &quot;problems&quot; regarding beer are sometimes _going_ to be regional**—finding beers to taste and exploring breweries seem like important activities for beer enthusiasts—activities necessarily tied to location.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What are your thoughts?"

The reason that multiple exchanges even arose is because Stack Overflow was lenient in some ways which were eventually deemed to be problematic. Hence the split into the main three sites.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main thing to keep in mind when moderating such a small exchange in my opinion is to think back to what made Stack Overflow popular to begin with. It was very open, and questions such as what is your favorite book excelled.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Will there be 50 questions for each state and 2000 questions for each country? If that begins to occur, then I think the questions could be closed under one canonical answer as a community wiki (as happens on Stack Overflow now).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But until then, I think it should be a little lenient with regards to closing or discouraging questions, especially so that new users do not feel alienated from the community. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If an answer is incorrect by all means point it out, but questions are going to be what builds the community here. Plenty of new exchanges have come and gone, and I think one of the keys is to strike a tolerant balance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Plenty of old questions were eventually closed or are no longer appropriate, but not until they reached tens if not hundreds of thousands of views.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Such as (all of these are from 2008)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[SQLite vs MySQL [closed]](https://stackoverflow.com/q/3630/1026459)  &#xD;&#xA;[SQL Client for Mac OS X that works with MS SQL Server [closed]](https://stackoverflow.com/q/3452/1026459)  &#xD;&#xA;[What is a better file copy alternative than the Windows default?

Thanks for participating in the meta as well as the main site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As discussed elsewhere in the meta, the consensus at Beer.SE is, unlike other stack exchanges, to allow regional questions _as long as they are sufficiently constrained_. There are hundreds of countries that produce beer, and therefore, although I think it's indeed a useful question, I agreed (with whoever cast the first close vote) that the question was [too broad].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Take a look at this question: [What does AngularJS do better than jQuery? [closed]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18414012/what-does-angularjs-do-better-than-jquery).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Try to remember that questions aren't closed because they're not useful, but rather because they don't fit certain site guidelines. Even if I don't personally agree with site guidelines (I'm actually closer to your side than you might think), as a moderator I am somewhat obligated to enforce the guidelines as set by the community. You'll still get reputation for upvotes of course—you just won't be seeing any new answers, since, it's been decreed the question covers too much ground and lacks specificity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, you've reminded me of this question of mine: https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/580/local-beers-to-try-at-airports-major-airports-only. To give you some context, at the time, the site was very young and I was trying to increase community participation by asking a &quot;fun&quot; question—a question any of us might remember the next time we're at a brewery in an airport. Some users commented immediately that the question wasn't well-suited for an SE site; I shared their sentiments and agreed to a motion to close. However, one might argue users aren't willing to act &quot;against&quot; a moderator. (Though, personally, I don't see close votes as antagonistic, at all. Also, I try to respect users by believing in their willingness to express honest thoughts; similarly I hope I have users' respect in trusting me to be able to handle said thoughts.) Now, the above question, I attempted to &quot;constrain&quot; by defining a &quot;minimum enplanements&quot; threshold. However, since I'm also allowing 1 airport per country _regardless_ off that criterion, clearly my question is even less constrained than yours! And especially since the site has grown and there's less of a need for the original purpose I sought to fulfill (fun, immediate participation), I will be consistent in my judgments and close my own question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please don't hesitate to speak up about things like this in the future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you still disagree with my judgment, that's okay! If you believe your question would be valid as a community wiki, then please find a meta.stackexchange.com post that helps substantiate your reasoning. (I'm placing the burden of proof on you, since the community has already voted according to its established system.)" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I've asked a fair number of questions in this area to date, but to be frank there just isn't a lot more that I want to know that would be appropriate for this site. And so the nature of not repeating questions on Stack Exchange means that activity is naturally slow here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If anything I think this speaks to questions over why and how we define a site as 'beta'.

We're hoping it will get interest from users of the now closed Alcoholic Beverages proposals &lt;sup&gt;([1](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/49291/alcoholic-beverages), [2](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/72735/alcoholic-beverages))&lt;/sup&gt;  to join the site and participate.   &#xA;&#xA;We want the community to succeed and if broadening the scope is needed, then let's go for it. &#xA;&#xA;### What's Next?&#xA;&#xA;The community will need to flesh out the new scope of the site.  What will be on-topic?  We will also need to come up with a new site name. &quot;Beer&quot; is too limiting, so [what should it be named](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/207404/standardizing-simplifying-se-site-names)?&#xA;&#xA;Once these are decided, then we will get the [highball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highball) rolling and have some fun with alcohol."

However, I found the chipotle added a nice roasty heat, so while it quenched your thirst after a spicy bite like a glass of milk might, it imparted just a smidge of heat in the aftertaste to segue into your next chili spoonful...

Thus I am wondering if we could add marijuana to the list of things as being on topic here, or if it would be even considered appropriate to do so?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [**Responsible use of Recreational Drugs**][1]&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The concept of &quot;responsible drug use&quot; is that a person can use drugs recreationally or otherwise with reduced or eliminated risk of negatively affecting other aspects of one's life or other people's lives. Advocates of this philosophy point to the many well-known artists and intellectuals who have used drugs, experimentally or otherwise, with few detrimental effects on their lives. Responsible drug use becomes problematic only when the use of the substance significantly interferes with the user's daily life.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Responsible drug use advocates that users should not take drugs at the same time as activities such as driving, swimming, operating machinery, or other activities that are unsafe without a sober state. Responsible drug use is emphasized as a primary prevention technique in harm-reduction drug policies. Harm-reduction policies were popularized in the late 1980s, although they began in the 1970s counter-culture, when cartoons explaining responsible drug use and the consequences of irresponsible drug use were distributed to users. Another issue is that the illegality of drugs in itself also causes social and economic consequences for those using them—the drugs may be &quot;cut&quot; with adulterants and the purity varies wildly, making overdoses more likely—and legalization of drug production and distribution would reduce these and other dangers of illegal drug use. Harm reduction seeks to minimize the harm that can occur through the use of various drugs, whether legal (e.g., **alcohol and nicotine**), or illegal (e.g., heroin and cocaine). For example, people who take drugs intravenously (cocaine, heroin) can minimize harm to both themselves and members of the community through proper injecting technique, using new needles and syringes each time, and proper disposal of all injecting equipment.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Common recreational drugs**&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; - [Alcohol][2]: Most drinking alcohol is ethanol, CH3CH2OH. Drinking alcohol creates intoxication, relaxation and lowered inhibitions. It is produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts to create wine, beer, and distilled liquor (e.g., vodka, rum, gin, etc.). In most areas of the world, it is legal for those over a certain age (18 in most countries). It is an IARC Group 1 carcinogen and a teratogen. Alcohol withdrawal can be life-threatening.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; - [Cannabis][3]: Its common forms include marijuana and hashish, which are smoked or eaten. It contains at least 85 cannabinoids. The primary psychoactive component is THC, which mimics the neurotransmitter anandamide, named after the Hindu *ananda*, &quot;joy, bliss, delight&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although I am only postulating adding **marijuana** to be added to the subjects as being on topic here. One could add other recreational drugs that are considered legal as a recreational drug use (in certain regions), but that seems doubtful at the present moment in time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The timeline: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Starting on August 16, users can [nominate themselves][1]. Users can also ask questions on meta for potential moderators to answer. (Use the `discussion` and `election` tags.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - On August 23, if there are two or more candidates we'll run an election. If not, I'll simply appoint the candidate. (There's a small chance we'll need to [remove a nomination][3], but I doubt that will come up.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - If there is an election, I'll announce the results on meta on August 31. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Note for current moderators: there's no need to nominate yourself even though you'll likely get an email saying you should. The system assumes the first election is a graduation election, which would mean moderators would need to be re-elected.

We combine coffee, beer, wine, spirits, marijuana, homebrewing, and other topics, perhaps even pharmaceuticals --- I was a bit disappointed when the recent pharmaceuticals Area51 proposal didn't get approved, since I often have questions about some of the chemically active prescriptions I've been recommended from my doctor. I'm sure also anyone who's been prescribed anti-psychotics, anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, or anxiety mitigated drugs like lorazopam, will attest to the fact that discussing those is not much different from discussing beer, wine, spirits, and marijuana, as they have very similar affects on the body.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The price range should be no more than $20.00 a bottle.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  3.

If you want to avoid seeing your edit blindly overwritten, first remove this comment. Rev.2 --&gt;&#xA;As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have [a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the preceding calendar year](https://alcohol.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=&quot;year+in+moderation&quot;+is%3Aquestion).&#xA;&#xA;As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.  &#xA;&gt; -- [A Theory of Moderation](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/)&#xA;&#xA;That doesn't eliminate the need for having [moderators](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/) altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.&#xA;&#xA;So as we say goodbye to 2021, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some [_exciting_ stats](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KZntT.gif).

[Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user)&#xA;&#xA;⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.&#xA;&#xA;⁵ Includes close flags (but *not* close or reopen votes).&#xA;&#xA;⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.&#xA;&#xA;⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).   &#xA;   &#xA;### Further reading:&#xA;&#xA;- Wanna see how these numbers have changed over time?
