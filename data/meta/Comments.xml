My issue is that I feel like ridding SE of 'Beer' and simply _allowing_ &quot;aficionado&quot; Q&amp;A in Homebrew would really just end up alienating the [perhaps small] group that isn't there to brew. It's a psychological issue; names _do_ matter. Although I do agree that aficionado types &quot;almost _have_ to&quot; **appreciate** homebrewing, I don't think a site called &quot;Homebrew.SE&quot; creates a comfortable environment for their implicitly &quot;off-topic&quot; discussions."
