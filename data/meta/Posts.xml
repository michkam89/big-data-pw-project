I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; typically an advocate for combining producers and end users, but in this case, there is simply too much overlap of interests &amp;mdash; not necessarily physical audiences, but &lt;em&gt;interests&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, if we were to remove the &quot;brewing-related questions&quot; from Beer SE (I'm not suggesting that), this site would become one big snooze fest fast. After I figure out what temperature to keep my beer&amp;hellip; and how to keep it going skunky, just about the only &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; questions left are those that DO veer into what goes behind the brewing process. The deeper &quot;consumers&quot; here are asking about the &quot;artisanship&quot;&amp;hellip; and that's the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; part of this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It makes sense, really. When there's a fervent appreciation for a subject (at least food/drink space), the &lt;strong&gt;more-engaged experts almost &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to delve behind the scenes&lt;/strong&gt; to study what separates good brews from bad; to understand the parameters that go into what they're &quot;appreciating.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don't have to be a literal &quot;brewer/craftsman&quot; to have an implicit interest in the subject.&lt;/strong&gt; Many of the beer enthusiasts here are curious about the craft &amp;mdash; you almost &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to, to appreciate the subject &amp;mdash; and that's why they are asking about it here. And of course the craftsmen need to know what makes a good beer &lt;strong&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt; so there's a lot of cross-cultural interests here, whether you an actual, literal &quot;home brewer&quot; not. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It simply makes sense to combine these subjects. While the brewers and consumers are not physically the same exact audience, they &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; largely seem to have the same range of interests&amp;hellip; and questions. Essentially, the scope of these two sites overlap considerably; much more than I would have anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/LtPf9.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put them back together.

This of course applies to &lt;a href=&quot;https://superuser.com/&quot;&gt;Super User&lt;/a&gt; as well. And Stack Overflow itself continuously evolves! Hence a never-ending stream of questions at &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt;. Office culture—no, more broadly, &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt; culture evolves, from 9-5ers to freelancers, from startups to corporations, giving &lt;a href=&quot;https://workplace.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Workplace&lt;/a&gt; its lifeblood, and laws too—changing laws are also a big component to the evolution which supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://money.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Personal Finance and Money&lt;/a&gt;. One last interesting example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;English Language &amp;amp; Usage&lt;/a&gt;, where both language and its more rapidly changing context give rise to new questions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/148323/is-there-a-non-sexual-phrase-for-sleeping-with-someone&quot;&gt;&quot;Is there a non-sexual phrase for sleeping with someone?&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...or the subject is huge (whether in breadth or depth)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are sites whose underlying subjects &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; necessarily evolve (or at least not very fast), &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;History&lt;/a&gt;. But the sheer size and/or intricacy of the subject lends it sustained opportunities for exploration—delving in to find genuinely new and interesting questions. Though sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Mathematica&lt;/a&gt; are bound to a (mostly) set language, from the (at least, seemingly) unlimited power of the language arises a huge domain of applications that users are continuously exploring, &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; surprised by the discovery of new challenges, new workarounds, and new techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I ask,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What kinds of questions will keep Beer.SE alive?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a preliminary opinion in mind, but one I don't feel qualified to develop into a full-fledged answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It just doesn't feel to me that Beer has as rich a history as, well, History itself, nor does it appear to lend itself to &quot;new applications&quot; and &quot;ways.&quot; Once we exhaust &lt;a href=&quot;https://alcohol.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/8/should-general-questions-about-beer-be-made-more-specific&quot;&gt;general questions&lt;/a&gt; about classifications of beer, bottling and distribution, temperature and skunking, and such, it seems fathomable we might even get through the histories of most classes of beers, techniques for tasting and pairing beers... and then what? &lt;strong&gt;All these subjects are ones which neither evolve nor introduce any great breadth or depth to be explored.&lt;/strong&gt; So what part of Beer &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have these qualities, for generating new questions?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To me (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/13493397#13493397&quot;&gt;others too, maybe&lt;/a&gt;), it seems one of the only evolving aspects of beer we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; latch onto, is specific beers and breweries. And putting such in the context of regions, too, would greatly expand what can be asked, and the specificity (and usefulness) of answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the usual culture against brand-specific questions and answers on SE, is understandable regarding, say, technology, where products and websites are often ephemeral, and more general answers would help direct future visitors toward the specific answers they need. And I think the usual culture against regional questions is understandable too, in that most communities don't want to end up with a hundred questions about the same thing, only differing in a seemingly arbitrary detail (location).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, I don't know if those cultures have to carry over to Beer.SE for Beer.SE to be an equally interesting and useful community. &lt;strong&gt;Our very subject is &lt;em&gt;embedded&lt;/em&gt; in its products,&lt;/strong&gt; whereas for technology, the subject is often an abstraction away from the products. And, &lt;strong&gt;our &quot;problems&quot; regarding beer are sometimes &lt;em&gt;going&lt;/em&gt; to be regional&lt;/strong&gt;—finding beers to taste and exploring breweries seem like important activities for beer enthusiasts—activities necessarily tied to location.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="73" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-23T12:37:40.143" LastActivityDate="2014-02-04T02:14:17.403" Title="What kinds of questions will keep Beer.SE active?

As noted, cider is closer to wine in production. As such, the questions and discussions of brewing techniques/technology will be less relevant to the those looking for cider information. There could also be less chance that people could usefully contributed to beer discussions if they are primarily interested in cider. It seems like cider would be too off-topic in this case since the motivation is the underlying production. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Consider the user base. Cider and beer are, right or wrong, frequently grouped together for sales, at parties, at bars, etc. One reason for this might be the placement of cider on taps. The real issue, however, is that since these two products are seen as very similar by consumers, this site could include cider as on-topic, drawing a greater audience, even if some of the discussion would be technically different from the beer discussions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I've got a great argument for one against the other. I will admit that I tend to side with 2) since I'm usually of the mind that more people makes a more vibrant community, even if that increases the noise-to-signal ratio. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="29" LastActivityDate="2014-02-04T14:29:52.897" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Same goes for searching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+community&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;beer community&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=beer+forum&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;beer forum&lt;/a&gt; (not that we are a forum—but it's what people would search).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the thing is, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these other communities, being &lt;em&gt;discussion forums&lt;/em&gt;, lack the unique model of Stack Exchange that promotes the best answers to the top and employs the community to organize knowledge in an accessible and duplicate-free way. We're far behind in terms of exposure, but we've still got &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; no one else seems to have. The question is—Does that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; justify the existence of this site?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Is there more we can do to meet our potential?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think so, and I feel guilty that I haven't taken the initiative to write this earlier, so thank you @dwjohnston for asking the question that needed to be asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, we might petition the Stack Exchange team to help us improve our SEO, for example by making sure that words like &lt;em&gt;discussion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;forum&lt;/em&gt; get picked up by crawlers. (No, I have no understanding of SEO; so please do enlighten me where I'm being naive.) Not all SE sites might like such exposure, since the SE platform isn't intended to be anything like a discussion forum especially. But, I think Beer.SE is a case where I think it would strengthen us to draw in those searching for &quot;forums&quot; to ask their questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, we might coordinate efforts to gain exposure in existing communities like BeerAdvocate, Realbeer.com, and Home Brew Talk. We'd want to do this &lt;em&gt;ethically&lt;/em&gt;—spamming forums with links to our site would only gain us a bad reputation. Exactly how to achieve this, I'm not sure, but perhaps this should be made a separate question for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="73" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-03T08:41:04.230" LastActivityDate="2014-07-10T07:18:02.613" CommentCount="2" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

My experience with SE sites is that if you build them, people come. Ask, answer and watch the visits flow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what does that leave us to do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ask good questions. A lot of the questions here are kind of mediocre, let's see if we can get some really good focused narrow questions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Focus on asking about &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; beer styles and brands instead of general &quot;beer&quot; questions. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As local questions. Promote at local pubs/breweries. Get local answers (A huge part of modern beer is local breweries, we can be an awesome resource for those).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Promote this site to your friends. This is the way to get experts and enthusiasts to show up. If you're hanging at the pub and someone has a question about a beer, have them ask it here!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So overall, while the numbers are kinda of lousy, SE hasn't said &quot;hey, you're in danger of closing up shop&quot; yet so there's still plenty of time to make this site a cool place.

Thanks for participating in the meta as well as the main site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As discussed elsewhere in the meta, the consensus at Beer.SE is, unlike other stack exchanges, to allow regional questions &lt;em&gt;as long as they are sufficiently constrained&lt;/em&gt;. There are hundreds of countries that produce beer, and therefore, although I think it's indeed a useful question, I agreed (with whoever cast the first close vote) that the question was [too broad].&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this question: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18414012/what-does-angularjs-do-better-than-jquery&quot;&gt;What does AngularJS do better than jQuery? [closed]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try to remember that questions aren't closed because they're not useful, but rather because they don't fit certain site guidelines. Even if I don't personally agree with site guidelines (I'm actually closer to your side than you might think), as a moderator I am somewhat obligated to enforce the guidelines as set by the community. You'll still get reputation for upvotes of course—you just won't be seeing any new answers, since, it's been decreed the question covers too much ground and lacks specificity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, you've reminded me of this question of mine: &lt;a href=&quot;https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/questions/580/local-beers-to-try-at-airports-major-airports-only&quot;&gt;Local beers to try at airports (major airports only)&lt;/a&gt;. To give you some context, at the time, the site was very young and I was trying to increase community participation by asking a &quot;fun&quot; question—a question any of us might remember the next time we're at a brewery in an airport. Some users commented immediately that the question wasn't well-suited for an SE site; I shared their sentiments and agreed to a motion to close. However, one might argue users aren't willing to act &quot;against&quot; a moderator. (Though, personally, I don't see close votes as antagonistic, at all. Also, I try to respect users by believing in their willingness to express honest thoughts; similarly I hope I have users' respect in trusting me to be able to handle said thoughts.) Now, the above question, I attempted to &quot;constrain&quot; by defining a &quot;minimum enplanements&quot; threshold. However, since I'm also allowing 1 airport per country &lt;em&gt;regardless&lt;/em&gt; off that criterion, clearly my question is even less constrained than yours! And especially since the site has grown and there's less of a need for the original purpose I sought to fulfill (fun, immediate participation), I will be consistent in my judgments and close my own question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please don't hesitate to speak up about things like this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you still disagree with my judgment, that's okay! If you believe your question would be valid as a community wiki, then please find a meta.stackexchange.com post that helps substantiate your reasoning. (I'm placing the burden of proof on you, since the community has already voted according to its established system.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="73" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-23T12:37:40.143" LastActivityDate="2015-06-04T06:34:39.887" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The moderator @badp replied:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The kind of question seeding we frown upon the hardest is the&#xA;  systematic one, as in a bunch of largely identical questions that&#xA;  differ slightly (e.g. asking &quot;how can I obtain an X&quot; for every item in&#xA;  an RPG). Either phrase the question more generally, or only ask for&#xA;  values of X that you actually are struggling/have struggled with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I side with this advice myself. For example, asking the BTU range for an IPA, then for a double IPA, then for a Pale Ale, and so on in separate questions, would be suspect. Instead, I'd encourage either (1) asking generally in a manner that seeks to answers some central curiosity of all these questions, or (2) asking about one or two kinds of beer due to genuine interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An even better example is when we discussed &lt;a href=&quot;https://alcohol.meta.stackexchange.com/a/86/73&quot;&gt;brand- or region-specific questions on this site&lt;/a&gt;. Questions like &quot;Where can I find &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;beer&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;?&quot; aren't great questions to spawn for the sake of increasing questions—they're often too specialized to help any future visitor. But when someone asks because they're genuinely having trouble finding a beer (and we seem to get this often from people who go abroad and can't get their hands on a beer they used to get at home), then we welcome the question. @MonicaCellio pretty much sums it up:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Limiting it to questions people actually care about should mitigate the fear of flooding the site with trivial questions. On the other hand, barring all of them just because some could be abusive, with our current question rate, seems unwise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All this may very well be obvious to you, so maybe I haven't provided much of an answer. So to answer in another way, I'd say this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go for it.&lt;/b&gt; Just use some discretion and common sense as you go along. If you're unsure about a post, then bump it to the bottom of your list and come back to it. If you're still unsure, try asking just the question and letting someone else respond, at least for 24 or 48 hours, before you self-answer.

Advocates of this philosophy point to the many well-known artists and intellectuals who have used drugs, experimentally or otherwise, with few detrimental effects on their lives. Responsible drug use becomes problematic only when the use of the substance significantly interferes with the user's daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Responsible drug use advocates that users should not take drugs at the same time as activities such as driving, swimming, operating machinery, or other activities that are unsafe without a sober state. Responsible drug use is emphasized as a primary prevention technique in harm-reduction drug policies. Harm-reduction policies were popularized in the late 1980s, although they began in the 1970s counter-culture, when cartoons explaining responsible drug use and the consequences of irresponsible drug use were distributed to users. Another issue is that the illegality of drugs in itself also causes social and economic consequences for those using them—the drugs may be &amp;quot;cut&amp;quot; with adulterants and the purity varies wildly, making overdoses more likely—and legalization of drug production and distribution would reduce these and other dangers of illegal drug use. Harm reduction seeks to minimize the harm that can occur through the use of various drugs, whether legal (e.g., &lt;strong&gt;alcohol and nicotine&lt;/strong&gt;), or illegal (e.g., heroin and cocaine). For example, people who take drugs intravenously (cocaine, heroin) can minimize harm to both themselves and members of the community through proper injecting technique, using new needles and syringes each time, and proper disposal of all injecting equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common recreational drugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Alcohol&lt;/a&gt;: Most drinking alcohol is ethanol, CH3CH2OH. Drinking alcohol creates intoxication, relaxation and lowered inhibitions. It is produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts to create wine, beer, and distilled liquor (e.g., vodka, rum, gin, etc.). In most areas of the world, it is legal for those over a certain age (18 in most countries). It is an IARC Group 1 carcinogen and a teratogen. Alcohol withdrawal can be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cannabis&lt;/a&gt;: Its common forms include marijuana and hashish, which are smoked or eaten. It contains at least 85 cannabinoids. The primary psychoactive component is THC, which mimics the neurotransmitter anandamide, named after the Hindu &lt;em&gt;ananda&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;quot;joy, bliss, delight&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although I am only postulating adding &lt;strong&gt;marijuana&lt;/strong&gt; to be added to the subjects as being on topic here.

href=&quot;https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/users/-1&quot;&gt;user #-1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;³ A &amp;quot;destroyed&amp;quot; user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. &lt;a

spam.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁵ Includes close flags (but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; close or reopen votes).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Further reading:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanna see how these numbers have changed over time? We posted a similar report here last year: &lt;a href=&quot;https://alcohol.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/246/2020-a-year-in-moderation&quot;&gt;2020: a year in moderation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackexchange.com/search?q=title%3A%222021%3A+a+year+in+moderation%22&quot;&gt;this report on other sites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or peruse &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/374784/208518&quot;&gt;detailed information on the number of questions closed and reopened across all sites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wishing everyone a happy 2022! ^_^&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3946" LastActivityDate="2022-01-12T16:28:43.747" Title="2021: a year in moderation" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;moderation&gt;&lt;statistics&gt;" AnswerCount="0" CommentCount="0" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />
